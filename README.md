# Kaggle_ASHRAE_GreatEnergyPredictor_3

## Description

Q: How much does it cost to cool a skyscraper in the summer? A: A lot! And not just in dollars, but in environmental impact.  

Thankfully, significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions.  

## Data 
Data Used

The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.

## Data Analytics 

# Are the improvements working? 

Reviewing pay for-performance financing by analysing the building owner payment = real energy consumption - (future consumption - retrofits). 

## Model 

(future consumption - retrofits)

We are going to develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters.

Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well.
